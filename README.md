# SpringBoot-Jpa-Gym

This project is made in Java using Spring Boot and JPA. It's an API for a gym.

How it works? *(It is still in production)*

This is made for a gym, so it has a gym Membership and your registration, a Trainer with your workload, and a workout that connects them, and this workout has an exercise and your type.
